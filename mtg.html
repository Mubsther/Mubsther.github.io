            <h1>Magic the Gathering</h1>
            <p>Magic the Gathering is a trading card game created in the USA in the 90s based off of the tabletop roleplaying game "Dungeons and Dragons", like most trading card games it is only two players (unless one player decides only they want to have fun). The in order to play cards you first need to play a land card that you can then "tap" for the appropriate mana, a mountain gives red mana, a forest gives green, a swamp gives black, a plains gives white and an island gives blue. These different mana types decide what cards you can play and shape how you construct a deck, with most decks only employing 1-2 as combining too many can make it inconsistent.</p>
