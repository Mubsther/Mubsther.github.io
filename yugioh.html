            <h1>Yu-Gi-Oh</h1>
            <p>Yu-Gi-Oh is a trading card game created in Japan based off of a manga by Kazuki Takahashi in 1996. In Yu-Gi-Oh, you don't use mana to play cards but instead each card has a set limit on it's usage with some being unlimited, and others being once per turn when it's on the field, but can be removed and placed back on the field to trigger again and finally cards that have a hard once per turn limit on all cards with that name. Yu-Gi-Oh is definitely the most complicated of the card games I play and has the steepest learning curve. The card game became popular in the west after localisations of the anime introduced it to kids outside of Japan, back then it was significantly simpler with each player only using maybe 1 or two cards a turn compared to the current game where it's quite common for a player to cycle through thirty cards on the first turn.</p>
