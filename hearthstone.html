            <h1>Hearthstone</h1>
            <p>Hearthstone is a digital trading card game created by blizzard entertainment in 2014, while the other two games also have digital games that you can play through, hearthstone being a digital only game means that it doesn't need to follow rules like it's being played physically, making random effects more possible. Hearthstone is much more similar to magic the gathering than Yu-Gi-Oh as it uses a mana system, albeit making things simpler by only having one type and creating deck variation by limiting certain cards to classes.</p>
